So there are some actions that I could automate:

Whenever I do an experiment, I grab the sd cards from the camera, then put them on my local machine and rename the files.
Sometimes I also put a bunch of .mp4 files on a drive where we backup our data.

Then I use my data pipeline, which basically consists of 4 .py files.

In theory I could automate all of this with some bash scripts, it wouldn't be difficult, I used to have a script for renaming the files.
But I think overall there's too much variation in the process, sometimes there are reasons why I only want to use some part of the data processing, 
which is why currently I think there's not much use in automating this.
